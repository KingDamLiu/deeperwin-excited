DeepErwin
=========

DeepErwin is python 3.8+ package that implements and optimizes wave function models for numerical solutions to the multi-electron Schr√∂dinger equation.
DeepErwin is built on JAX, allowing to define wavefunctions using the familiar numpy-syntax and compiling to highly-performant GPU-models.

In particular DeepErwin supports:

- Optimizing a wavefunction for a single nuclear geometry
- Optimizing wavefunctions for multiple nuclear geometries in parallel, while sharing neural network weights across these wavefunctions to speed-up optimization
- Using pre-trained weights of a network to speed-up optimization for entirely new wavefunctions
- Using second-order optimizers such as KFAC or BFGS


A detailed description of our method and the corresponding results can be found in our recent `arxiv publication`_. Please cite this paper, whenever you use any parts of DeepErwin.


Getting Started
===============

The quickest way to get started with DeepErwin is to have a look at our :doc:`tutorial`.
It covers installation, usage of core functionality and major configuration options.

Afterwards take a look at the comprehensive documentation of the source code and APIs: :doc:`api`
