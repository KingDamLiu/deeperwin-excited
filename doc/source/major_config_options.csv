Option,Sub-options,Description
**physical**,name,"Name of the molecule to be calculated, e.g. N2, CO, etc. For several small molecules this automatically popoulates the geometry, nuclear charges, electron number and spin"
,"R, Z, n_electrons, n_up",Physical properties (e.g. geometry) of your system in atomic units (bohr)
**model**,name,"Type of model to use, e.g. ""dpe1"" (arxiv:2105.08351), ""dpe4"" (arxiv:2205.09438), ""ferminet"". This sets all model-related defaults and allows subsequent changes to be made from there."
,features.use_local_coordinates,Enable/disable a local coordinate system for each ion
,"features.use_distance_features, features.use_el_el_differences, features.use_el_ion_differences",Choose input features to be fed into embedding: Distances (scalar) and/or differences (3D vectors)
,embedding.name,"Type of embedding to use to use, e.g. ""dpe1"", ""dpe4"", ""ferminet"""
,embedding.n_iterations,Number of embedding iterations (=embedding network depth)
,"embedding.n_hidden_one_el, embedding.n_hidden_one_el","For FermiNet, DeeepErwin: Number of hidden neurons in one-electron and two-electron streams"
,orbitals.n_determinants,Number of determinants to use for building the wavefunction
,orbitals.enevelope_orbitals,Config-options related to FermiNet-like exponential envelope orbitals
,orbitals.baseline_orbitals,Config-options related to PauliNet-like orbitals from a baseline calculation (e.g. Hartree-Fock)
**optimization**,optimizer.name,"Type of optimizer, e.g. ""adam"", ""rmsprop"", ""kfac"", ""kfac_adam"""
,learning_rate,Initial learning-rate during optimization. May be modified during optimization by the LR-schedule (optimization.schedule).
,n_epochs,Number of epochs to train the wavefunction model. In each epoch all n_walkers walkers are updated using MCMC and then optimized batch-by-batch.
,"mcmc.n_walkers, mcmc.n_inter_steps, mcmc. ...",Settings for Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling during wavefunction optimization. Analogous settings can be found within evaluation and pre_training.
**evaluation**,n_epochs,Number of evaluation steps after the wavefunction optimization
**pre_training**,n_epochs,Number of supervised pre-training steps to take before variational optimization
**logging**,"wandb.entity, wandb.project","When set, this enables logging of the experiment to Weights&Biases. Set logging.wandb=None to disable W&B-logging (default)."
**computation**,n_devices,Number of GPUs to use for parallelization
,require_gpu,"Abort computation when no GPU is found, instead of computing on CPUs"
**reuse**,path,Path to a directory containing a previously successfully finished wavefunction optimization to use as initializer for this experiment.
